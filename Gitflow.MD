1. Branching Strategy


## Branch Structure

### Main Branches
- **`main`**: Production-ready code, always deployable
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features, staging environment

### Supporting Branches
- **`feature/[role]-[description]`**: Individual feature development
  - Example: `feature/frontend-login-page`
  - Example: `feature/backend-user-auth`
  - Example: `feature/data-dashboard-setup`

### Branch Lifecycle
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Work on feature with regular commits
3. Push to remote when ready for review
4. Create pull request to `develop`
5. Delete feature branch after merge


2. Pull Request Process


## Pull Request Workflow

### Creating PRs
- **Source**: Feature branch
- **Target**: `develop` branch
- **Title Format**: `[ROLE] Brief description of changes`
- **Description**: Include what changed, why, and testing notes

### Review Process
- **Required Reviewers**: Minimum 1 team member
- **Review Focus**: Code quality, functionality, team standards
- **Approval Required**: At least 1 approval before merge

### PR Labels (if using)
- `feature`: New functionality
- `bugfix`: Bug resolution
- `documentation`: Documentation updates
- `security`: Security-related changes


3. Naming Conventions


## Naming Standards

### Branch Names
- Format: `[type]/[role]-[brief-description]`
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Examples:
  - `feature/frontend-user-dashboard`
  - `bugfix/backend-api-error-handling`
  - `feature/data-analytics-pipeline`

### Commit Messages
- Format: `[Component] Brief description of change`
- Examples:
  - `Frontend: Add user login form validation`
  - `Backend: Implement JWT authentication`
  - `Data: Create initial EDA notebook`


4. Conflict Prevention Strategy


## Avoiding Merge Conflicts

### Daily Practices
- **Morning Sync**: Pull latest `develop` before starting work
- **Regular Pushes**: Push work at least daily to backup progress
- **Communication**: Announce when working on shared files
- **File Coordination**: Discuss overlapping work in daily standups

### Before Creating PR
1. Pull latest `develop`
2. Merge `develop` into your feature branch
3. Resolve any conflicts locally
4. Test that everything still works
5. Push and create PR

### Communication Protocol
- **#dev-updates channel**: Notify when pushing major changes
- **Daily Standup**: Mention files/components you're working on
- **Before Big Changes**: Check with team if changes might affect others
