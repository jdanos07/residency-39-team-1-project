# Neurodivergent Friendly Productivity App

## Project Overview
 Many adults struggle with executive function, but traditional productivity apps cause shame and guilt when users "fail" to complete tasks in linear, rigid systems.

 Our goal is to create the first productivity app that makes ADHD adults feel "seen" rather than inadequate, with emotional safety as the primary design principle. The app will celebrate partial progress and provide dopamine-rewarding feedback. It will honor nonlinear thinking patterns without judgement.
